# Hi there, I'm Vlad Frangu! 👋 <img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=vladfrangu" alt="" align="center" />

I'm a Full Stack Developer from Bucharest! ✨ I'm a very fast learner in most programming languages and an open-source software creator; with focus on: [`TypeScript`] (and JavaScript 👀), [`Kotlin`] (and [`Java`]), [`Vue`] & [`React`] (with TSX, of course), [`C#`] and a bit of [`Rust`] 😄

- 😄 Pronouns: anything you want, as long as it isn't offensive to anyone. He, she, they, doesn't matter to me
- ⚡ Fun fact: I learn the fastest by diving head first into a problem / new thing, NOT by researching it first. While counter intuitive, this has helped me get started with the world of programming! Nowadays, I do research, but after I tried doing it myself first 😅
- 👀 I have an interesting relationship with some languages (like [`Go`]); I can read and understand the source code and what it does, but I cannot write in the language at this time

## 📚 Experience

I'm a self taught, full stack developer, that went head first into coding and fell in love from the first lines of code I've written! Started coding around **September of 2016**, with [`Java`], although not actively. Since **January of 2017**, I started being far more active in coding, and moved to JavaScript as my main language. I then moved to [`TypeScript`] around 2018 (due to it's better coding experience), which is what I use daily now. In 2019, I started using other languages (such as [`Rust`] or [`Kotlin`]), and in 2020, I started looking more into [`C#`].

### Key Notes ✍️

- Self taught, full stack developer
- Started coding in **2016**, at the age of **14**
- Over 5 years of experience with **JavaScript** and over 3 with **[`TypeScript`]**
