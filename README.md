# Hi there, I'm Vlad Frangu! 👋  <img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=vladfrangu" alt="" align="center" />

I'm a Backend-focused Developer from Bucharest! ✨ I'm a very fast learner in most programming languages and an open-source software creator; with focus on: [`TypeScript`] (and JavaScript 👀) & [`Vue`] & [`React`] (with TSX, of course). I've also experimented with [`Kotlin`] (and [`Java`]), [`C#`] and a bit of [`Rust`] 😄

- 😄 Pronouns: anything you want, as long as it isn't offensive to anyone. He, she, they, doesn't matter to me
- ⚡ Fun fact: I learn the fastest by diving head first into a problem / new thing, and if that doesn't work, by researching it. While counter intuitive, this has helped me get started with the world of programming! Nowadays, I do research, but after I tried figuring out the solution by myself 😅
- 👀 I have an interesting relationship with some languages (like [`Go`]); while I can understand the code and how it works, I am much slower at writing it compared to languages I'm more comfortable with (like [`TypeScript`])

## 📚 Experience

I'm a self taught, full stack developer, that went head first into coding and fell in love from the first lines of code I've written! Started experimenting with coding around **September of 2016** in the [`Java`] programming language. Since **January of 2017**, I switched to JavaScript as my main language, and shortly after moved to [`TypeScript`] (thanks to its much better coding experience), which is what I use daily now. I've also experimented with other languages (such as [`Rust`], [`Kotlin`], [`C#`] or [`Go`]), but so far my language of choice is still [`TypeScript`].

### Key Notes ✍️

- Self taught, full stack developer
- Started coding in **2016**
- Over 7 years of experience with **JavaScript** and over 6 with **[`TypeScript`]**
- Willing to learn new things all the time, and work in teams 😄
